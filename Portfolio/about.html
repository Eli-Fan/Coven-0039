          Rooted in Photorgaphy, Film, Sculpture, and Performance, Elias Fan's works question and explore how humans interact with reality. Trapped in weak entities of flesh and blood, human souls crave libration. Forever in history, predecessors resort to a higher power to seek greater spiritual and mental power and fill the gaps of the most primal desires for sex, love, food, and of human nature. Religions, Witchcraft, and Cults were thus conceived and spread for better practices. Rituals and worships never fade away from, though they seem to, our kind. They just transform, responding to the strongest urges and the greatest fears of the current time. From Amazon tribes, medieval churches, Tibetan temples, and witch covens, to the concrete city jungles, we never stop praying. And in this sense, art is like rituals.
