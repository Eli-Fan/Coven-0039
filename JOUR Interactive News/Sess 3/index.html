<h1>The Witch Condition</h1>
<div id="Byline"> By Eli F </div>

<!--adding body and div here to define the area differently to create the double boundaries, maybe there is a better way? -->

<p id="intro">
    Responding to this moment of institutional harm and generational distrust, The Witch Condition draws from cinema classic Suspiria to speak to the present. The work uses the supernatural not as fantasy, but as a framework to think through how bodies absorb, resist, and reinterpret institutional pressure.</p>

<p class="concept">
    The story explores a trilogy of feminine struggle: three presences across time that inhabit the same individual, co-existing in the same space. Self-confronting pain, suppression, transformation, and ultimately, ascension, it's a narrative about power reclaimed, and identity rewritten.</p>

<p>Partially inspired by the movie

    , the editorial channels a ritualistic, Berlin-inflected witch-modernist aesthetic: a static visual essay as body-politics, touching gender, upbringing, and the architectures of control. It is a study of self-transgression, a hysterical dystopia rendered through choreography and image.</p>
