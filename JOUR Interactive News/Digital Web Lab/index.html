    <h1>Schiaparelli Couture 2026: A Digital Immersive Experience</h1>
    <div id="Byline">By Eli F</div>

    <p id="intro">
      Couture week doesn't just show clothes: it shows power. This season, the pressure felt sharper because Dior and Chanel are entering new eras with new creative leadership, which changes what people expect couture to "be." In that atmosphere, Schiaparelli's show reads like a response: surreal, sculptural, and theatrical, but also controlled enough to feel like a statement instead of chaos. This digital web lab page uses three different tools to create an immersive experience of the show for those who can't sit by the runway: a Juxtapose slider to compare Schiaparelli's designs to Dior's and Chanel's, a SceneVR 360 embed to immerse the reader in the runway environment, and SoundCite audio clips to let the reader hear the runway music while reading.

    <h2>Schiaparelli vs Dior & Chanel</h2>

    <p>
      Under pressure of the debut shows of two of the biggest fashion housese, Chanel and Dior, under their new creative directors who where both hired for their publicly acknowledged talent, Daniel Roseberry at Schiaparelli is cooking up something that feels like a statement.

    <h2>A 360 View of The Runway Atmosphere</h2>

    <p>
      Now imagine you are invited as a guest to this spectatular show. What would it feel like to be there? The ambience, the lighting, the music, the energy in the room? The SceneVR embed below attempts to recreate that immersive experience by letting you explore a 360 view of the runway environment as if you were there in person.

    <h2>Show Note, Read with The Runway Music</h2>

    <p>
        Finally, runway shows are as much about the music as they are about the clothes. The soundtrack sets the tone for the collection and influences how the audience perceives the designs. Below is a short show note about Schiaparelli's collection, with an inline audio clip of the runway music that you can play while reading.
